This is my own implementation of the [TensorFlow Core article "Classification on imbalanced data"](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data).

I implemented it from scratch to gain experience with imbalanced dataset use cases. It aligns very well to my project on Renault Group about Predictive Maintenance for spot welding robots, where failures of robots also occur very rarely in time.
